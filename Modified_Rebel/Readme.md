Overview
- Rebel_Alg -> Runs through the Rebel whole rebel algorith
- game_tree -> Builds subgame trees as a directed graph, (game wrapper is currently in here as well i want to move it)
- PBS -> class for PBS that serves as search tree nodes

Still need to do
- plug in a cfr implementation
- implement game wrapper probably for leduk
- Training Loop
