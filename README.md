# MetaLearning2020 

This repository contains the code used for our MIT 6.883 Meta-Learning Fall 2020 course project.


For testing purposes, we have included a number of third part algorithm and game implementations as submodules.

As of November 1st, 2020, we are still in the process of implementing ReBeL in python with wrappers to interface with a number of game libraries. The files can be found in the '''Modified_Rebel'''  folder are in the process of being modified and debugged. More details [here] (https://github.com/damienwmartin/MetaLearning2020/tree/main/Rebel#python-rebel-implementation)
