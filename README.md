# MetaLearning2020 

This repository contains the code used for our MIT 6.883 Meta-Learning Fall 2020 course project.


For testing purposes, we have included AlphaZero and OpenSpiel as submodules. All games and algorithms used for this project will run on the OpenSpiel Framework.

As of October 28, 2020, we are still in the process of implementing ReBeL into the OpenSpiel framework. The files in the Modified_Rebel are in the process of being modified and debugged such that it can run on Open Spiel Games.
