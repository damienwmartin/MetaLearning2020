# Python Rebel Implementation

## Overview
The main files for our rebel implementation are...
- full_rebel.py -> Runs through one iteration of the rebel algorithm
- game_tree.py -> Builds subgame trees as a directed graph and contains addition methods for setting values of leaf nodes, updating policy, etc.
- CFR.py -> TODO: FILL IN
- players.py -> TODO: FILL IN
- tasks.py -> TODO: FILL IN
- training_loop.py -> TODO: FILL IN

## Folder structure
The `tests/` folder contains test cases for confirming successful installation and that the implementation is working correctly.

The `games/` folder contains implementations of games.
To use your own games, implement the functions in `games/game_wrapper.py`.
