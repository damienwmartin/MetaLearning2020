# Python Rebel Implementation

## Overview
The main files for our rebel implementation are...
- Rebel_Alg.py -> Runs through one iteration of the rebel algorithm
- game_tree.py -> Builds subgame trees as a directed graph and contains addition methods for setting values of leaf nodes, updating policy, etc.
- PBS.py -> class to represent Public belief states that serves as search tree nodes

'''Rewritten C code'' contains files we are converting from the authors original C++ implementation directly into python to get a better understanding of the algorithm and '''OriginalRebelCode''' contains the python files from the authors implementation for reference.

## To do:
- plug in a cfr implementation
- finish game_tree methods
- Training/Evaluation Loop
